<h1>Real-time log</h1>

<p>(Without timestamps)</p>

<p>Continuing the theme of transparency, I thought it might be
amusing/illustrative to show how I solve problems like this one.  I
know what I want to do: make a webpage to post a line of text to look
at later.  Now to actually do it.</p>

<p> Here's a key to the hightlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text with no background color are (mostly) in-line notes of what
  I was doing</li>
  <li>Horizontal lines separate phases of the project</li>
  <li class="leadup">Lead-up: thinking I did before starting coding
  </li>
  <li class="search">Search: I went and searched for reference
  material to refer to in order to make sure I knew what I was doing.</li>

  <li class="coding">Coding: actual code got written</li>
  <li class="yak">Yak-shaving: technical stuff I worked on that was ancillary to
the task at hand</li>
<li class="distraction">Distractions: distracting thoughts, mostly

because I thought it might be interesting to see how much I actually
get distracted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before creating the repo</h2>

<p class="leadup">I know I want to use PHP on the server side, since it's
ubiquitous.  I want to save the content to a file on disk, since
databases aren't very durable.  My first thought is a fortune(1) file,
because that's how you store lots of little snippets of text.</p>

<p class="leadup">Then I had a moment of clarity: appending over and over like that
is going to fuck up at some point.  So, let's use lots of little files
instead of one big one.</p>

<p class="leadup">I consider how to group things and make them discoverable.  Do I
want a web interface to read all the contents back?  No: it's useless
to me, but very useful to anyone who finds a copy of this on the web
and wants to abuse it.  Having this be write-only is probably good.
Also, it's simpler, less to write.</p>

<p class="leadup">I'll probably use hashtags to group stuff for myself, and I need to
figure out how to publish these ideas later on.  But that's the next
problem.  Now to get it going.</p>

<p class="leadup">Security?  How do I keep other people out of my
business?  I could do something complicated with magic tokens in the
bookmark URL on my phone, but that's going to be complicated.  I could
put it behind htaccess, but I don't want to log in all the time.  The
goal is to not disrupt my silly little idea.  I think I'm going to run
with obscurity: put it in a randomly-named subdirectory on my webhost
and go from there.  How to structure that subdirectory?  I could put
it in /i1jo3i1j23oi1j2/ or in /oijoi/oi1231j23/23hbfaf/ -- is one
better than the other?  The single directory is better: it doesn't
allow partial matching (eg the lock codes in movies, where all the
digits spin, then the leftmost one locks, then the second locks, etc).</p>

<h2>Created the repo with 'undertake project idea_php'</h2>


<p>So, PHP and writing files.  This is something I've done before, but
don't do often enough to remember how to do it.  To google!  <span class="search">Look up how to write to a file in PHP again: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=php+write+to+file">[php write to file]</a></span></p>

<p>While that's running, I'm thinking about how to
write this first piece of code.  I need the PHP script to show the
input form if it's called without arguments <span
class="distraction">A crappy Weezer song comes on; I switch over to my
browser to snark about it on the twitters</span> <span
class="yak">That last span reminds me that I should add CSS classes to
the different kinds of content in this file</span>.  So anyway.  I
need the PHP to print the form if no arguments, but write the text if
it gets arguments.  The break in mental state to come over here and
<span class="distraction">Writing on the couch is making my back hurt,
moving to the front room.  The window is open, need to close it.  The
curtains get in the way; I'm reminded that I need to buy new
curtains. The window is sticky and won't close; I curse old houses,
latex paint, and wet days.  Maybe I should use my Leatherman to scrape
off some paint there?  No, need to finish writing this doc.  This
distraction note itself becomes a non-trivial distraction.
Meta.</span>.  The break in mental state is <span class="yak">Thinking
about how to format this so it's clear what's what and so you can
possibly maybe read the text around the distractions.  Colors? Make
the yakshaving/distraction spans super/sub scripts?  Should I double
the baseline height to make that work with bigger sub/sup text?</span>
The break in mental state reminded me that I can use a static HTML
page to submit a form to a CGI.  It's clearly been a while since I did
web stuff.</p>

<p>Google results show a new method I haven't seen before, <a
 href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.file-put-contents.php">file_put_contents()</a>,
which looks nice.  Actually, a coworker used this on a project at
work; I was dubious, but it's apparently not a brain-dead
implementation, so it's efficient.  But efficiency doesn't matter
here, so that's fine (it mattered a lot at work).  Oh, wait, it's PHP5
only.  Going to use fopen/fwrite/fclose, since I don't know if my
 webhost is on PHP4 or 5 and don't really care.</p>

<p><span class="search">Look up the API calls to double-check my understanding of them.  <a
 href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php">fopen()</a>, <a
 href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.fwrite.php">fwrite()</a>, can
see fclose()<span class="distraction">Should I make these things
fixed-width/tt?  Is tt still the right tag for that?
Meta-distraction: emacs autocompleted "distr" to "distractions", so I
had to glance back to make sure whether I was using it in singular or
plural.</span> in the example code for those, so I feel confident in
how it works.</span></p>

<p class="coding">Write 5 lines of PHP, including dummy variables for
the filename and the idea text.</p>

<p><span class="search">Now to get the variable content out of a PHP POST.  <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=php+POST+variables">[php POST
variables]</a>.  Easy, though I misremembered the var name (I thought
$POST, not $_POST).</span></p>

<p class="coding">Update 1 line of PHP to extract the POST content.</p>

<p>PHP time() is time(), right?  <span class="search">Search for it on the PHP site: <a
href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.time.php">time()</a>: yep.</span></p>

<p class="coding">Update 1 line of PHP to set the filename to time() +
".txt".</p>

<p><span class="search">Now to remember how to write an HTML form: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html+form">[html form]</a>.  <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp">W3Schools' HTML
Form Page</a> has an example that's good enough for me.</span> They also have
a thing that reminds me that the tag for a big text box is textarea,
and that I can specify cols and rows.  Not doing that for now.</p>

<p class="coding">Add a trivial HTML form: 4 lines of HTML.</p>


<p>Now to test run.  <span class="yak">Does OS X's ~/Sites/ support PHP scripts?  Just
trying it with a dumb little foo.php that does "echo 'hi';".  Nope,
rendered as a text file.  <span class="search">A quick google confirms this: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=os+x+webserver+php&oq=os+x+webserver+php&aqs=chrome.0.57j62l3j60l2.3388&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">[os
x webserver php]</a> gets me <a
href="http://foundationphp.com/tutorials/php_leopard.php">A
complicated tutorial for Leopard</a>.  Not directly relevant, but it's
discouraging enough for me.</span></span></p>

<p>Throwing it on my webhost.  Surprisingly, it worked.  Now to commit
and then start documentation.</p>

<p>Looking at the PHP before committing, I realize that
I want to not create empty text files by accident.  Add error
handling.  <span class="coding">5 lines of PHP</span>.</p>

<p>Documentation above committed as a first draft.  Now need to add
CSS for style, then review the above and put the right CSS classes on
the elements.  After that, I want to templatize the HTML directory
here.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Have working code, commit and revise doco</h2>

<p class="coding">Net result of above: 11 lines of PHP and a 4 line
HTML Form (wrapped in a bunch of emacs default HTML).</p>

<p>Making a new CSS file for this log thingy, since I may do this
again on another project.  Created the file, now cribbing off another
webpage's link rel tag to remember the sort of arcane syntax for
this. <span class="distraction">Cut and paste from a webpage.  Noticed
the number of arguments and possible orderings: it seems like there's
a lot of data in the order of them, whether or not media is included,
etc, wondering if it's possible to fingerprint them or trace lineage.
Hunh.</span> </p>

<p>Actually writing CSS now <span class="distraction">Cleaning up
browser tabs to close a window full of junk, realize that a tab that I
closed automatically needs to get put into the links document for the
project I was working on a couple hours ago.  Reopening closed
tabs to find it, then cutting and pasting over.</span></p>

<p>CSS looks okay structurally; committing now, then one more
structural/semantic edit pass, then a pass to make it pretty.</p>

<p>Looking over this, decide that I want to add coding sections to
show how little code actually came out of all of the above. <span
class="distraction">Paying attention to how distractable I am reminds
me that maybe I need to take my next ADD pill.  Check the clock.  Not
yet.</span>  Look back over, add total line counts, seems like it's
coming together.</p>

<p class="distraction">Feels like this is taking forever.  Try to
figure out how long I've been working on this, kind of space out in
the process.  Catch myself, realize I can check the git log, since
undertaker creates an initial commit of the README, and I committed
the working copy pretty quickly.  I can make the time estimate even
better by looking at the copy I scp'd up to my webhost.  15 minutes to
get to a workingprogram, and just over an hour to now.  Seems longer.
Also, I have a small hangnail that's bothering me (fingernails are one
of my nervous/bored/unfocused tics).</p>

<p>Take a small mental brake to clear my head, then come back for the
actual semantic review, which I got distracted from by adding the
coding sections above.</p>

<p><span class="yak">Added a key to the top of the document.</span>
I'm going to make this more attractive, then go back to the review.
The webpage is kind of unreadable, and reiewing in HTML is distracting
to me.</p>

<p>Need to make the non-core things easier to separate from the text.
Maybe the baseline thing I was thinking about.  <span
class="search">Looking for how to adjust baseline in CSS: <a
 href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&tbo=d&q=css+vertical+spacing&oq=css+vertical+spacing">
[CSS vertical spacing]</a>, after a few false starts ("text baseline",
"CSS text baseline")</span>.  Editing this paragraph made me think
enough to realize it's probably a terrible idea, more distracting than
<i>not</i> spacing things, so back to finding suitably faint
highlighting colors for the other properties.</p>

<p>I need to pick colors.  I think about digging out the stuff I've
done before, but I'm not sure where it's at, so I'm going to start
from scratch, again.  <span class="search">Looking for color scheme
generators or something <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html+color+picker">[html color picker]</a> doesn't get what I was
looking for (obvious in retrospect)</span>, but does get me <a
href="http://www.colorpicker.com/">colorpicker.com</a>, which is
useful, even though OS X the exact same damned thing built in
(somewhere, which I'd have to find).</p>

<p>Okay, that looks much better.  Calling it finished enough.  Fuck
templatizing for now.  I'm going to send this to some friends and get
feedback.  And actually deploy it to a private place on my server!</p>

<hr>
<h2>Commit doco</h2>

<p>Committed everything above.  Now what?  <span
class="distraction">Wow, I'm really hungry, and the alarm for my pill
went off a bit ago, and the mail just came.  I think it's time to eat
and figure this out.  I'll deploy a copy first, though, and set it up
on my phone while I eat.</span></p>
