This is a trivial note-grabbing webpage script.

It's meant to be there to transcribe little ideas I had over the
course of the day, accessible from a button on my phone's homescreen
or a browser bookmark.

It's just a text area that writes to a timestamped text file in a
directory.  There's a cron component that runs on another host to make
a copy of that directory of timestamped files.

It secures itself through obscurity; I don't want to solve the shared
token problem, and I don't want to put htaccess in my way.
