<!-- {{ Title: idea_php: scribbles from anywhere }} -->

<h1>idea_php</h1>

<p>This is a trivial note-grabbing webpage script.  It's intended to
be bookmarked in your browser boookmark bar and on your phone's home
screen, to allow you to quickly scribble a note to yourself from
anywhere. It has no security, and is write-only (you need to manually
copy out the .txt files it creates).  This is great for me, but may
not be so good for you.</p>

<p>It's meant to be there to transcribe little ideas I had over the
course of the day, accessible from a button on my phone's homescreen
or a browser bookmark.</p>

<p>Also possibly interesting: I kept <a href="log.html">a fairly
detailed log of idea_php's creation process</a>, mostly as an
experiment in doing so.  It was kind of helpful, but kind of got in
the way, so I'm contemplating ways to make that process smoother.</p>
