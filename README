idea_php
========

This is a very basic note capturing application. 

Its homepage is at
  http://www.joshisanerd.com/projects/idea_php/

It's just an HTML file and a PHP script that writes form submissions
directly out to text files.  As such, it's not really appropriate to
be deployed on the real web, except maybe in a very obscure directory
on your webserver.  Even then, it's quite insecure, and you shouldn't
use it.  I do, but you shouldn't.  Do as I say, not as I do.

The script is write-only.  To get the content out of that webserver
directory, you'll need a cron job to rsync it off over ssh or some
such.  I leave that as an exercise for the reader (this is partly a
filter: if you're not able to do that automation, you probably
shouldn't be using this in its current, horrifically insecure, state).

It's intentionally trivial: the design is that you place it in a
random directory on your webhost, then bookmark it in your desktop
browser's bookmark bar and on your phone's home screen.  You're then
one step away from writing small/medium/large notes to yourself.
Personally, I've been using it with voice recognition on my phone, and
it's been great.

web/ -- Documentation and development notes
code/ -- The code implementation.


Deployment: copy the contents of code/ to a new, randomly-named
directory on your webserver.  That should be it, assuming your
webserver supports any vaguely recent version of PHP.
